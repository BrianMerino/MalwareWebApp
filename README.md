# MalwareWebApp
  This project was created while I was a CCI Intern at ORNL during Summer 2021. This project will not work due to no being able to connect to the proper DB anymore. The purpose 
  of this project was to query a remote MongoDB database, which contains around 700,000 samples of malware data, and bring back data on each sample. This project was created 
  using a mix of Python, Django, HTML/CSS, and MongoDB. The web application works by entering a query into the search bar. When entered, the web application will bring back 
  a list of malware samples that match your query. Each sample that returns has basic details shown and also has a button that is labeled 'Full Details' that shows 
  the malware smaples full JSON data. The application includes a log in feature as well as pagination. There were some features I wish I could have added but I ran out of time.
  Some of these include: Finding a good limit of documents returned, Adding page number buttons to allow user to skip around, and Being able to add a download link for each 
  malware sample. My mentor for this project was Kevin Spakes @ ORNL.
